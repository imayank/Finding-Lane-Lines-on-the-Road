Overview
---
One of the primary task when driving a vehicle is to keep the vehicle in a proper lane. We as humnas identify different lanes using the lane markings - the lines drawn on the road, as reference and steer the vehicle accordingly. So, the first very important step for a self-driving car is to detect lane markings on the road to identify and follow the lane.

In this project a pipeline is developed for identifying the lane markings of the lane where the vehicle is driving using *Python and OpenCV.*  *OpenCV* is a popular package containing various tools for image processing.

The Project

* A writeup explaining various steps of the project is also included titled as **writeup.md**. This is a great place to start to understand the project.
* To run the project successfully install the following python dependencies:
    * numpy
    * matplotlib
    * cv2
